# Biofilms_MALDI

This repository holds all raw data that have been analyzed in:

**"Application of MALDI-TOF-MS to the evaluation of the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis."**

Authors: Cáceres, ME., Ledesma, Martín M., Lombarte Serrat, A., Sordelli, DO., Carlos Vay., Giacomodonato M., Buzzola, FR*. 

This repository contains five folders with raw MALDI-TOF-MS (Archive.1 to Archive.5) data of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis growing over different culture media. It also includes 1 CSV archive that contains the metadata (Metadata.csv) of the MALDI data folders. 

* Metadata.csv:

This table shows isolate names (Isolate), biological replicates of each isolate (Isolate_rep), the number of technical replicates within biological replicates (Spot_rep), the culture media (Culture_media), the MALDI identification of each replicate (MALDI_Identification), the Archive where spectra are allocated (Archive), the folders numbers within each Archive that contains the spectra (Number_Init_folder and Number_End_folder). These last columns must be interpreted as follows: the folders that contain raw spectra of biological replicate 1 of RA22 isolate were allocated in Archive 1 and comprised folders 10, 11, and 12.
